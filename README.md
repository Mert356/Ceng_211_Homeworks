## HW01 – The E-Sports Tournament Challenge
In this homework, a simple **tournament management system** is implemented in Java.  
The program reads data from CSV files (`games.csv` and `gamers.csv`) and simulates matches for multiple players.  
It calculates points, assigns medals, and prints several query results such as the highest-scoring match or medal distribution.

Topics covered:
- Classes, constructors, getters, setters  
- CSV file I/O  
- 1-D and 2-D arrays  
- Basic object-oriented programming principles

## HW02 – Scholarship Evaluation System
In this homework, a **Scholarship Evaluation System** is implemented in Java.  
The system automatically evaluates multiple scholarship applications based on academic performance, financial need, or research output.  
All applications are read from a single CSV file (`ScholarshipApplications.csv`), which contains mixed records from different scholarship types.

This assignment focuses on **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **dynamic data structures** such as ArrayLists.  
It emphasizes building an extendable architecture capable of handling new application types with minimal code changes.
 
Topics Covered:
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- CSV file I/O using standard Java I/O libraries  
- ArrayLists for flexible data storage  
- Class hierarchies and abstract classes  
- Data encapsulation and code reusability

More assignments will be added as the semester continues.
