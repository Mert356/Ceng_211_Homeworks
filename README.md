## 🧩 HW01 – The E-Sports Tournament Challenge
In this homework, a simple **tournament management system** is implemented in Java.  
The program reads data from CSV files (`games.csv` and `gamers.csv`) and simulates matches for multiple players.  
It calculates points, assigns medals, and prints several query results such as the highest-scoring match or medal distribution.

Topics covered:
- Classes, constructors, getters, setters  
- CSV file I/O  
- 1-D and 2-D arrays  
- Basic object-oriented programming principles

More assignments will be added as the semester continues.
